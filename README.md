I chose to do show the rates of death due to cancer in each state. The data came from https://github.com/blakeluther/csv/blob/master/uscs_map_death_all.csv, which used CDC data as its source.

I used a choropleth map. I considered, and even attempted, an interactive map, but I prefer charts that are intended to be printed. The choropleth map was sufficient to describe the data, so I decided on that.

I wanted to give a quick impression of cancer death rates per state to see if there was a discernable trend. There clearly is one starting with Kentucky being the highest and dissipating radially from there. It would be interesting to cross-reference these results with others to find a cause/culprit.
